# Morse-Code-Translator

# Description

This is a Python-based Morse Code Translator that converts text to Morse code and vice versa. It supports alphanumeric characters (A-Z, 0-9) and spaces, with a simple command-line interface for user interaction.

# Features

1) Convert text to Morse code (e.g., "SOS" to "... --- ...")

2) Convert Morse code to text (e.g., "... --- ..." to "SOS")

3) Error handling for unsupported characters and invalid Morse code sequences

4) Interactive menu for easy navigation

# Notes

1) The program is case-insensitive for text input (e.g., "sos" or "SOS" both work).

2) Unsupported characters in text input will trigger an error message.

3) Invalid Morse code sequences (e.g., sequences not matching A-Z or 0-9) will also trigger an error.

4) Use three spaces to separate words in Morse code input.
